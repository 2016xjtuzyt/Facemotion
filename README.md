# Facemotion

**Facemotion** it's an iOS app, allowing you to find easily a contact by *face recognition*.
Scan the face of a person, whether the contact is in the local storage, it can be detected by the recognition algorithm. Or add the detected frames to a new contact among your own iOS contacts. And then can be recognise later by the application.

## üíªüéâ Technologies

- **Realm** database to store detected face and contact lists
- **OpenCV** for faces recognition algorithm / image processing
- **AVFoundation** for face detection / some image processing

## Installation and usage

First thing to do is to install the pods.
I choosed a pod for **opencv**, instead a built framework for easy integration. It can take a long time compiling. (1 hour macbook 13 inch üò¨üòø)
```
pod install
```

Run the project on a real device. üçî
